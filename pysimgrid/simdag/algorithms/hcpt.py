  Heterogeneous Critical Parent Trees (HCPT) scheduler.

  HCPT is based on heuristics to find a critical path in worflow and schedule it with
  the highest possible priority.

  The key part is 'guided' topological sort which finds a schedulable order selecting cricial
  nodes as early as possible.

  For more details and rationale please refer to the original publication:
